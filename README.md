Backend (Flask API) â€“ serves prediction endpoints using a trained model.

Frontend (Flask/HTML/JS) â€“ user interface for entering loan applicant details and viewing results.

Model Training â€“ Python pipeline that trains a calibrated Random Forest classifier on loan data from PostgreSQL.

Connects to PostgreSQL database to fetch loan data.

Provides REST APIs:

GET /features â†’ returns required input fields.

POST /predict â†’ returns approval probability.
